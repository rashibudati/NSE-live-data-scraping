# NSE-live-data-scraping
This repo contains the script to scrape live data of SBIN index from NSE website and save the result to a text file which can later be imported in intervals to excel for further analysis/calculations.

### Note:
The code can be modified to get more labels from the website of any index fund/stocks. <br>
I have scraped only few values('Open'	'High'	'Low'	'LTP'	'T Close'	'P Close'	'V change'	'P change')
